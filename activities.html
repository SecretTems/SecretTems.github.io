			<h2><strong>MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Rhelyn Espiloy and Geriz Francisco</strong></p>
			<p>Problems are inevitable part of our life, as the problems
				file us up. We often felt and asked ourselves if "are we
				worthy?" "Why my life does turns out like this?" or “do I
				deserve to be treated like this?”It looks like a simple
				question yet it brings a great impact in our whole being
				and wrecking our will to continue the path of life
				Dr. Henry Cocoy DR. Nacpil, Rpm, RGC, PhD share his
				knowledge and expertise on the 10th day of November
				year 2023 held at the main campus of Asia Pacific
				College of Business and Arts. He discussed a lot of
				techniques on how to deal with the problems we've been
				encountered and will be encountering in our daily lives,
				highlighting the three most important things in dealing
				the problem we have. First, through the connection of
				our Mighty God. He explained a lot of things regarding
				to the positive feedback's we can achieve by having a
				close connection on him. Second, observe. Observing
				the people around you, can also be a great help. By doing
				so, one might understand the reason why does that person
				do that kind of a thing. Third, Timing. Finding the right
				timing can make the atmosphere more comfortable for
				the individual when opening themselves towards their
				family, friends, or to anyone whom they made an
				argument. Furthermore, he also encouraged the students
				to open up when encountering problems in life. Helping
				us to realize that we do not live in a deserted island
				where we only live by our own, he shows us by using his
				words that we can always seek and ask for help to others.
				Caging yourself with that heavy feeling will never be a
				<br><br>
				Dr. Henry Cocoy deliberately give time for the students of
				APCBA to asked him for a guidance regarding about the
				things that they we’re wary about. Either, it is a problem
				concerning to their families or even to their emotions that
				feels being invalidated when opening their self to others,
				and how will an individual will know whether someone is
				already have an anxiety or depression. When they know
				their self well that they are fine enough? Those kinds of
				question are what the students frequently asked while
				having Dr. Cocoy as their mental health advisor. With his
				knowledge and experiences he was able to give a
				satisfactory answer to the questions thrown upon him. He
				also been able to give some tips and techniques to the
				students of APCBA in dealing to that kind of situation
				The discussion last for at least 3 hours, yet
				brings a great realization to the students who are
				experiencing the storm of life and made them realize that
				after the storm they are facing right now, it will certainly
				have a better tomorrow, a better tomorrow wherein
				rainbows will set upon the clouds, giving the radiance and
				colors to their colorless life.
				The lessons, knowledge, and wisdom that
				bestowed upon us APCBA students will forever be remain
				in our hearts. This seminar became the light in the dark
				path of our life.

			<h2><strong>Expression or Uniformity?</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Sheena Nicole C. Mendoza</strong></p>
			<p>School dress code is one of the most
				controversial topics that is often brought up
				in a debate or discussion. The conflict is
				always between the expression and
				uniformity of the students. But first, what
				is the dress code? The dress code is a
				common policy in school that students
				must obey.
				This means students are required to wear
				uniforms unless it is civilian clothes day or
				P.E. day.
				Having a proper dress code in
				school gives equality and fairness to each
				student. It can help to lessen the worry and
				peer pressure of students before going to
				school. For example, some
				students say these things:
				“I don’t know what to wear anymore.”
				“I think my clothes are not suitable in school.”
				“I am scared people will judge me if they saw me
				wearing something like this.”
				Now, if all students wear the same attire, they won't have
				to worry anymore because everyone will look similar.
				<br><br>
				Furthermore, LGBTQ+ in Asia Pacific College
				of Business and Arts has been approved to wear
				uniforms based on the gender they are acknowledging.
				They are free to cross the suitable clothes for gender as
				long as they are not violating the dress codes.
				According to Pasoquin, J. (2020), “Students
				are generally identified about their level of education and
				affiliation from their uniform or a formal dress for ages.”
				Having a dress code can have such significance for a
				student. A student can be easily recognized by which
				school they are at. In case of an emergency, people can
				basically identify a student by the uniform they are
				wearing. In which can help provide necessary
				information. Dress codes also help to identify which
				students are classified depending on the dress code that
				the school administrator sets. For example, the level of
				education they are in have a different color of uniform.

			<h2><strong>WORLD TEACHER’S DAY</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By:Sheena Nicole Mendoza</strong></p>
			<p>
				World Teacher’s Day is celebrated annually
				on the 5th of October. This
				international event is a tribute to all
				educators for their unwavering
				hard work and perseverance in teaching. Asia Pacific College
				of Business and Arts teachers should not only honor the ways
				in which they revolutionizing the field of education, but also
				consider the assistance that they require to properly utilize the
				students’ determination and dreams in life.
				At Asia Pacific College of Business and Arts
				(APCBA), the celebration took place on October 6, 2023, for a
				specific reason. On Friday morning, students expressed
				appreciation and gratitude to every APCBA teacher by
				surprising them with flowers, handmade gifts, crochets, letters,
				cakes, chocolates, certificates of appreciation, and various
				gifts. Based on the teachers' reactions, they seemed touched by
				the students' efforts and expressed their thanks.
				<br><br>
				In the afternoon, all the teachers gathered at
				Dentofarm Resort, especially the APCBA teachers. This was
				to celebrate Teacher’s Day with our beloved mayor, Mayor
				Trina Andres, who held the event. “The celebration was truly
				enjoyable, featuring games. Mayor Trina also gave us a token
				of appreciation for every teacher. I had a delightful time at
				Dentofarm,” said Ma'am Marimark.
				On Teacher’s Day or even a normal day, let us
				always reflect on the invaluable contributions of educators in
				shaping minds and inspiring futures. As we express gratitude
				for their tireless dedication, let's remember that the impact of a
				teacher extends far beyond the classroom, leaving an enduring
				mark on generations to come.

			<h2><strong>Remembering Ma’am Hannah</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Rhelyn Rashmin V. Espiloy and Gheriez F. Bajet</strong></p>
			<p>
				Do you still remember the happy-go-lucky teacher?
				Just like a river that flows down to the alley,
				the memories and contribution of Asia Pacific College
				of Business and Arts very own Ma’am Hannah G.
				Sotes flashes like a thunderstorm raging in the ears
				and memories of the sweet yesterday. Ma’am Hannah,
				a kind, loving, considerate and awesome teacher, coworker, friend, sister, and daughter still lingers in the
				hearts and minds of everyone she encountered during
				her short but blissful, well-lived life.
				<br><br>
				To Her Former Students, the Asianites
				In almost a year that had passed, the smiling
				face and warm aura that Ma’am Sotes possessed gave
				joy and hope to her beloved Asianites she taught.
				When asked, her students referred to her as someone
				who you can rely on, the one who you can open up to,
				and the one who would stand by your side the moment
				you feel that the world is against you. She will
				definitely be there by your side, willing to extend her
				arms in order to help you in overcoming and defeating
				those strange thoughts and feelings you have seldom.
				Certainly, encouraging and helping the
				students became her forte without her knowing it.
				"Siya yung tipo ng titser na ip-push ka n'ya na
				ipakita yung talent na meron ka, talent na akala
				mo wala ka, pero meron pala at hindi mo lang ‘yon
				nalalaman," stated by her former college student in APCBA.
				<br><br>
				With her words and stares that carry no judgement
				but simple care and love that once brimmed into those
				beautiful eyes of hers, lifted and motivated the students to
				believe in themselves, because each of them is blessed with
				gifts that they need to discover, explore, and develop.
				In addition, the moment the students started
				describing what kind of a person Ma’am Hannah was, one
				could see the sparks in their eyes; the way they lit up
				together with the joy it reflected while they were talking
				about her. “Kapag kasama mo siya, ang gaan sa feeling. Ang
				gaan kase alam mo na hindi ka niya idya-judge kundi
				palalakasin niya pa yung loob mo,”.

			<h2><strong>The Unexpected Passing of a Basketball Rising Star</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Janna Arabela S. Mauro</strong></p>
			<p>"A beautiful heart with
				a beautiful soul" – this is how Joshua B. Moran described John
				Lloyd Palma, his classmate and best friend. “Bentong”, as what
				many called him, was the kind of person, who was always happy
				and full of humor. According to Moran, with just few jokes from
				him, one can laugh uncontrollably. He was cheerful, fond
				of laughing and joking with his teachers and classmates,
				and most importantly – kind.
				Aside from these, John Lloyd was a good
				cousin, a polite nephew, but above all, a loving and caring
				only child to Mrs. Julieta Palma, a single parent and an
				overseas Filipino worker.
				<br><br>
				Palma was a resident of Poblacion Centro,
				Rizal, Nueva Ecija and a 21-year-old 2nd Year Diploma in
				Hospitality and Tourism Technology regular student at
				Asia Pacific College of Business and Arts.
				As a student, John Lloyd was a comic one.
				Joshua shared that even when their teacher was in class or
				discussing in front, Palma was secretly eating on his seat.
				In the field of basketball, as a usual Most
				Valuable Player (MVP) awardee, Bentong was a
				prominent basketball figure not only to Rizaleňos but to
				other basketball enthusiasts and fans from other towns,
				for he was one of the basketball players who represented
				the municipality of Rizal in intertown basketball cups
				such as Mayor Kokoy Salvador Basketball League.
				It was where he acquired a lot friends with
				whom he can confide his problems in life, for basketball
				was where most of his life revolved,
				but it was also the reason his life that was full of
				dreams and potentials was cut short.
				<br><br>
				On November 12, 2023 at around 6:00-7:00PM,
				Bentong was riding his motorcycle to Cabucbucan to play
				basketball. Like the usual, he was with his friends and teammates.
				However, while they were traversing the dark
				portion of Calaocan-Cabucbucan road along hectares after
				hectares of rice fields, an overspeeding motorcycle crashed
				into John Lloyd Palma. The drunk driver was dead on the
				spot, because of the impact. Bentong, on the other hand, was
				hit gravely hit on his head but still conscious and gasping for his dear life.
				The Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and
				Management Office (MDRRMO) personnel of Rizal
				responded immediately on the situation and rushed Palma to
				the nearest hospital in Cabanatuan City. Unfortunately, John
				Lloyd did not make it. They lost him on the way in
				Pinagpanaan, Talavera.

			<h2><strong>Opportunity for TESDA graduates</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Rolly Limos</strong></p>
			<p>Nitong taong 2023 ay may halos 310 na libreng
				skills training na isinagawa sa APCBA main campus at
				APCBA Bongabon Campus. Ang mga scholarship
				program na naibahagi ay mula sa Universal Access to
				Quality Tertiary Education Act na may kabuoang 225,
				Training for Work Scholarship Program na may bilang na
				35 at Special Training for Employment Program na may halos 50 scholar.
				Kung ating paghahambingin ang bilang nang
				naipamahaging TESDA program sa nagdaang taon ay
				masasabi na mas marami ang sa taong ito dahil kung
				susumahin ay nadagdagan ng 95 na mga scholar mula sa
				dating 215 TESDA scholar. Sa pagdami ng benepisyo sa
				scholarship na ito ay mas maraming mamamayan ang
				maaring magkaroon ng trabaho, at ayon nga sa datos ng
				TESDA - Central Luzon ay 8 sa 10 TESDA graduate ay
				agad na natatanggap sa trabaho hindi lang dito sa Pilipinas
				kundi pati sa ibang bansa kaya marami sa kababayang
				Rizaleno at kalapit bayan nito ay hindi pinapalagpas ang
				pagkakataong makakuha ng programang ito.
				<br><br>
				Samantala, marami parin ang hirap makahanap
				ng trabaho kahit sila ay graduate na sa TESDA ngunit kung
				paghuhusayan at magtityaga ay tiyak na makakahanap ng
				maayos na trabaho, sabi nga ng marami “nasa Diyos ang
				awa, nasa tao ang gawa”. Ayon nga sa TESDA bagamat
				hindi ito direktang nagbibigay ng employment
				opportunities sa mga graduates, may mga programa naman
				itong inilulunsad na naglalayong makatulong sa mga
				graduates nito na nangangailangan ng trabaho o livelihood,
				tulad na lamang ng world cafe of opportunities at ang 911
				TESDA. Ang APCBA ay dinadagsa parin ng mga
				mamamayan upang makapag-aral at mapaunlad ang
				kakayan, isa rin sa dahilan ng pagdagsa ay ang malapit
				sakanila ang paaralan na hindi na kailangang mag-aral ng
				TESDA sa malayong bayan.

			<h2><strong>APCBA Celebrated the National Language Month</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Jhanise Gamboa</strong></p>
			<p>"Filipino at Mga Katitibong Wika: Wika ng
				kapayapaan, seguridad at inklusibong pagpapatupad ng
				katarungang panlipunan", the celebration's main concept
				during the National Language Month.
				 On September 4, 2023, during National
				Language Month, students competed in a number of
				categories. There were a total of seven categories: Spoken
				Word Poetry, Photography, Quiz Bee, Poster Making
				(Traditional and Digital), Food Festival (Pista ng
				Pagkain), Song Competition (Group and Solo/Duet), and
				the competition between Lakan and Lakambini of all
				strands and departments. The said event was originally
				scheduled to include Filipino Games (Larong Pinoy), but
				due to unforeseen circumstances, it was taken out.
				 Jorge Castro Jr. of 12 ABM was crowned as
				the Lakan of Asia Pacific College of Business and Arts
				together with the named Lakambini, Jamaica Miguel from
				DHTT Regular 2nd Year. Lakan and Lakambini was the
				newest category added because of administrators
				persuasion.
				<br><br>
				The award was an additional feather in the cap
				for Princess Mae Langcay, an student from DHTT Scholar
				in Spoken Word Poetry. Third placer was a Grade 12
				HUMSS student, and the second placer from the second
				year of BTVTED together with her won an achievement
				in the said contest.
				The group and the solo or duet were the two
				subcategories of the Song Competition. In the Kundiman
				Song Category, DHTT Scholar Waves 2 and 3 won first
				place. The winner of the solo or duet category is Ar-jay
				Lucero, a competitor from DHTT Scholar Wave 1.
				Aminah Antonio, a DHTT Scholar Wave 4
				representative, won the poster making competition by
				placing first in the traditional category. A student in Grade
				11 HUMSS named Daina Torres won first place in the
				Digital Poster Making Competition. Marileth Matutino of
				BTVTED 2nd Year emerged triumphant in the Quiz Bee
				with 32 points, her gap with the second place, a Grade 12-
				ICT was 2 points, and her advantage with the third place
				finisher from Grade 12 STEM was 4 points.
				<br><br>
				The Food Festival, also called Pista ng Pagkain, was one
				of the contests to enter in addition to the previously
				mentioned activities. In the Senior High School
				Department, the Grade 11 GAS emerged victorious over
				their peers representative and STEM was able to secure
				first place in Grade 12. Last but not least, the BTVTED
				second year won the Food Festival College Category,
				proving that they had achieved success.
				 The Photography Competition comes last. The
				winner was the competitor from BTVTED's second year,
				and the runner-up was from ICT 12th Grade.
				 Plenty of thanks to Sir Marlon D. Lazaro, a
				Filipino Department Committee, as well as the other
				instructors and administrators. The students relished the
				celebration of National Language Month as the event went
				smoothly from beginning to end.

			<h2><strong>Rice Prices Ceiling</strong></h2>
			<p><strong>By: Andrea D. Garote</strong></p>
			<p>
				I am the student who has been given a chance to speak of what I
				feel. We are an adults, open our eyes though ears.
				Rice price ceiling is usually
				authorized by the government to make affordable for
				the consumers. We should not only see the one side of
				this issue, because producers will be more affected
				in this price ceiling.
				Yes, price ceiling will limit cost of
				consumers and it keeps things affordable but cannot we
				see the cons of this action. They may have not produce
				as much, causing more shortages. Some are able to
				force out of business if they cannot realize a reasonable
				benefit on their goods.
				Farmers, too, will be hurt by the price
				ceilings. Unable to have their rice sold in markets
				because of rising costs ( farm-gate is already at or near
				P20 per kilo), they themselves may choose to stop
				planting rice. Alternatively, they may cut corners or
				produce cheap but bad-quality rice.
				August 31, 2023, amid skyrocketing rice
				prices, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
				<br><br>
				issued an executive order imposing mandatory price
				ceilings on rice. Started on September 5, retailers
				must sell regular-milled rice at no more than P41
				per kilo and well-milled rice at no more than P45 per kilo.
				Doing otherwise will be illegal. In fact, violators face
				hefty penalties: they can be imprisoned for “less than a year”
				and be fined anywhere from P5,000 to P1 million.
				Seeing the unsustainability of this, many retailers may eventually
				choose to exit the market and not sell any rice at
				all. In fact, some retailers are threatening to do so as early as now.
				Why is it price ceiling have to be apply only on the rice (crops)
				area? How about limit the cost for the agricultural
				products such as insecticides and fertilizers because this is one
				of the reason why farmers suffered from financial losses.
				The money was spent on the fertilizer did not return because of
				the low price of rice. And I think limit the cost of
				agricultural products will be the answer in this problem.
